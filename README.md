# LAB 4 - OOP (Java Swing Student Form)

This is my Laboratory Exercise 4 in Object-Oriented Programming.  
The activity is about creating a **Student Form Application** using **Java Swing**.

## 🚀 Features
- GUI built with Swing (`JFrame`, `JPanel`, `JTextField`, `JButton`, `JTextArea`)
- Organized layout using `GridLayout`
- Input validation:
  - Name must include first name and last name
  - Age must be a positive number
  - Student ID must be exactly 11 digits and start with "24"
  - Course input is automatically converted to UPPERCASE
- Displays student details in a text area
- Shows error messages for invalid inputs

```

Student Information:

Name: Nik D

Age: 20

Student ID: 24012345678

Course: BSIT

```

When inputs are invalid (example: wrong ID):
```

Error: Student ID must be 11 digits and start with '24'.
